### 🐦 namer_app

A simple, evolving Flutter app for generating name pairings.  
Originally built by following the [Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab) codelab — now extended into a playground to learn Flutter and experiment with UI concepts.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped from the official Flutter codelab. To run it locally:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Make sure you have Flutter installed and set up properly. You can check by running:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

## ✅ Features Implemented (Post-Codelab)

Here are the additions made since finishing the official tutorial:

1. 🔁 History Tracking – Keeps a scrollable list of previously generated word pairs.

2. ❤️ History Favorites – Tap to mark word pairs in the history as favorites.

3. 🗑️ Delete Functionality – Remove items from favorites and history individually.

## 🛠️ Planned Features
This project is actively evolving as a learning tool. Here are my plans for future additions:

1. 🔍 Search – Search within favorites or history.

2. 📋 Copy to Clipboard – Tap to copy a word pair.

3. ☁️ Persistence – Save favorites across sessions (e.g. SharedPreferences or local DB).
